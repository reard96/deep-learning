# Deep Learning

Here are the course files from the [Coursera Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning).

I ran all of the Jupyter notebooks on Coursera's server and saved them statically in this repo. 

_Note: I didn't add the associated image files to the repo unless the Jupyter notebook looked weird on GitHub, meaning if you download the repo to run locally, the images may not be correct._
