## The basics of ConvNets

###### 1. What do you think applying this filter to a grayscale image will do?

- Detect vertical edges
###### 2. Suppose your input is a 300 by 300 color (RGB) image, and you are not using a convolutional network. If the first hidden layer has 100 neurons, each one fully connected to the input, how many parameters does this hidden layer have (including the bias parameters)?

###### 3. Suppose your input is a 300 by 300 color (RGB) image, and you use a convolutional layer with 100 filters that are each 5x5. How many parameters does this hidden layer have (including the bias parameters)?

###### 4. You have an input volume that is 63x63x16, and convolve it with 32 filters that are each 7x7, using a stride of 2 and no padding. What is the output volume?
- 
###### 5. You have an input volume that is 15x15x8, and pad it using “pad=2.” What is the dimension of the resulting volume (after padding)?
