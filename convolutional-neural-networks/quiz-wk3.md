## Detection algorithms

###### 1. You are building a 3-class object classification and localization algorithm. The classes are: pedestrian (c=1), car (c=2), motorcycle (c=3). What would be the label for the following image? Recall *y = [p<sub>c</sub>, b<sub>x</sub>, b<sub>y</sub>, b<sub>h</sub>, b<sub>w</sub>, c<sub>1</sub>, c<sub>2</sub>, c<sub>3</sub>*
- y = [1, 0.3, 0.7, 0.3, 0.3, 0, 1, 0]
