## Detection algorithms

###### 1. You are building a 3-class object classification and localization algorithm. The classes are: pedestrian (c=1), car (c=2), motorcycle (c=3). What would be the label for the following image? Recall *y = [p<sub>c</sub>, b<sub>x</sub>, b<sub>y</sub>, b<sub>h</sub>, b<sub>w</sub>, c<sub>1</sub>, c<sub>2</sub>, c<sub>3</sub>*
![Image of Car](/convolutional-neural-networks/images/car.png)
- y = [1, 0.3, 0.7, 0.3, 0.3, 0, 1, 0]

###### 2. Continuing from the previous problem, what should y be for the image below? Remember that “?” means “don’t care”, which means that the neural network loss function won’t care what the neural network gives for that component of the output. As before, *y = [p<sub>c</sub>, b<sub>x</sub>, b<sub>y</sub>, b<sub>h</sub>, b<sub>w</sub>, c<sub>1</sub>, c<sub>2</sub>, c<sub>3</sub>*

- y=[0,?,?,?,?,?,?,?]

###### 3. You are working on a factory automation task. Your system will see a can of soft-drink coming down a conveyor belt, and you want it to take a picture and decide whether (i) there is a soft-drink can in the image, and if so (ii) its bounding box. Since the soft-drink can is round, the bounding box is always square, and the soft drink can always appears as the same size in the image. There is at most one soft drink can in each image. Here’re some typical images in your training set:
